The new building was designed byThomas Turnbulland featured electric lighting, an Otis hydraulic lift, 3000 feet ofLamson tubes(pneumatic cash-carrying pipes) and the largest tea room in the city.[22]Departments in the store at this period included drapery, mercery, clothing, mantles, millinery, accessories, ladies' underclothing, furnishings and floor coverings. The top floor was a workshop or factory for dressmaking and tailoring, and there was a large basement for inwards goods.[22][23]Part of Kirkcaldie & Stains' success at this time came from postal orders: the company sent out illustrated seasonal catalogues and received 15,000 to 20,000 orders each year from customers outside of Wellington.[23][24].In 1908–1909, the next phase of the expansion took place when Kirkcaldie & Stains built a three-storey building on the Occidental Hotel site at the corner of Lambton Quay and Johnston Street. The building was constructed of reinforced concrete and featured a flat roof for parking delivery vehicles.[34][30]In 1909–1910, the 1868 wooden building at the corner of Lambton Quay and Brandon Street was replaced with a three-storey building of reinforced concrete.[35]The store now occupied a street frontage from Johnston street, around Lambton Quay to Brandon street. Four of the five buildings that made up the Kirkcaldie & Stains operation were now in the Italianate style designed by William Turnbull..During 1927–1928, Kirkcaldie & Stains remodeled the 1897 building on Lambton Quay in the Italianate style, unifying the façade that stretched from Johnston Street to Brandon Street..In 1985, British Overseas Stores sold the property to Renouf Corporation (later Hellaby Holdings).[38]The historic façade was retained but the building behind it was demolished and replaced with a new three-storey department store topped by a car park.[39]During the reconstruction period, half of the building closed for demolition while trading continued in the other half and some nearby rental space. Then that half of the building was demolished while trading moved to the newly built section.[40]The brass Lamson tubes that had carried cash through the building for almost 80 years were repurposed as hand rails on the staircases in the new store. The rest of the site was redeveloped, involving the construction of two 13-storey office towers on top of the three-storey podium extending to the rear of the shop premises.[41]The project was completed in 1989.[39]This project was one of the first in Wellington where a new building was constructed while retaining a historic façade, and it was not considered particularly successful from an architectural point of view.[39][41]In 1993, the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (nowHeritage New Zealand) downgraded the building's classification due to the changed presentation of the façade.[39]As of 2023, it hasCategory 2 Historic Placeclassification.[42]
